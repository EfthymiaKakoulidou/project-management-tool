# [PROJECT MANAGEMENT TOOL](https://project-management-tool-70101b30ec1e.herokuapp.com/)

The Project Management Tool has as a purpose to help users and teams to organize their workload. 
A user can add a project, add tasks to it and assign these tasks to colleagues. Information such as deadline dates and when a project or task were created help have controll of their work. The possibility to see your tasks ranked from the most urgent to the least urgent help ptioritize their work and organize their day. In addition the user can create his/hers profile and check others profiles as well. This has a purpose to create a pool of proffessionals that one can check their titles and bios so that they can choose the right people for their project.
A quote on the landing page of the Project Management Tool is added to help start working motivated!

## UX

The purpose of the rpoject is to organize work so I want to have a clear and simple structure so that one can navigate easily into the site. 

### Colour Scheme

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑 START OF NOTES (to be deleted) 🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑

Explain your colours and the colour scheme.

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑 END OF NOTES (to be deleted) 🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑

- `#000000` used for primary text.
- `#E84610` used for primary highlights.
- `#4A4A4F` used for secondary text.
- `#009FE3` used for secondary highlights.

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑 START OF NOTES (to be deleted) 🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑

Consider adding a link and screenshot for your colour scheme using "coolors".
https://coolors.co/generate

When you add a colour to the palette, the URL is dynamically updated, making it easier for you to return back to your colour palette later if needed.

Example:

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑 END OF NOTES (to be deleted) 🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑

I used [coolors.co](https://coolors.co/e84610-009fe3-4a4a4f-445261-d63649-e6ecf0-000000) to generate my colour palette.

If you've used CSS `:root` variables, consider also including a code snippet here!

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑 END OF NOTES (to be deleted) 🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑

I've used CSS `:root` variables to easily update the global colour scheme by changing only one value, instead of everywhere in the CSS file.

```css
:root {
    /* P = Primary | S = Secondary */
    --p-text: #000000;
    --p-highlight: #E84610;
    --s-text: #4A4A4F;
    --s-highlight: #009FE3;
    --white: #FFFFFF;
    --black: #000000;
}
```

### Typography

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑 START OF NOTES (to be deleted) 🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑

Explain any fonts and icon libraries used, like Google Fonts and/or Font Awesome.

Consider adding a link to each font used, and the Font Awesome site if used (or similar icon library).

Example:

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑 END OF NOTES (to be deleted) 🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑

- [Montserrat](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Montserrat) was used for the primary headers and titles.

- [Lato](https://fonts.google.com/specimen/Lato) was used for all other secondary text.

- [Font Awesome](https://fontawesome.com) icons were used throughout the site, such as the social media icons in the footer.

## User Stories

The user stories created in the beginning of the project helped to organize the structure of the site. The navigation bar was cretaed based on their needs.

## Wireframes

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑 START OF NOTES (to be deleted) 🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑

In this section, display your wireframe screenshots using a Markdown `table`.
Instructions on how to do Markdown `tables` start on line #213 on this site: https://pandao.github.io/editor.md/en.html

Alternatively, dropdowns are a way to condense several wireframes into a collapsible menu to save space.
Dropdowns in Markdown are considered some of the only acceptable HTML components that are allowed for assessment purposes.

**IMPORTANT**! **IMPORTANT**! **IMPORTANT**!
The example below uses the `details` and `summary` code elements.
However, for these scripts to work, I've had to add spaces within the `< >` elements.

You MUST remove these spaces for it to work properly on your own README/TESTING files.
Remove the spaces within the `< >` brackets for the `details` and `summary` code elements,
for the Mobile, Tablet, and Desktop wireframes.

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑 END OF NOTES (to be deleted) 🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑

To follow best practice, wireframes were developed for mobile, tablet, and desktop sizes.
I've used [Balsamiq](https://balsamiq.com/wireframes) to design my site wireframes.

## Database Design

Entity Relationship Diagrams (ERD) help to visualize database architecture before creating models.
Understanding the relationships between different tables can save time later in the project.

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑 START OF NOTES (to be deleted) 🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑

Using your defined models (one example below), create an ERD with the relationships identified.

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑 END OF NOTES (to be deleted) 🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑

```python
class Product(models.Model):
    category = models.ForeignKey(
        "Category", null=True, blank=True, on_delete=models.SET_NULL)
    sku = models.CharField(max_length=254, null=True, blank=True)
    name = models.CharField(max_length=254)
    description = models.TextField()
    has_sizes = models.BooleanField(default=False, null=True, blank=True)
    price = models.DecimalField(max_digits=6, decimal_places=2)
    rating = models.DecimalField(
        max_digits=6, decimal_places=2, null=True, blank=True)

## Agile Development Process

### GitHub Projects

[GitHub Projects](https://github.com/EfthymiaKakoulidou/project-management-tool/projects) served as an Agile tool for this project.
It isn't a specialized tool, but with the right tags and project creation/issue assignments, it can be made to work.

Through it, user stories, issues, and milestone tasks were planned, then tracked on a weekly basis using the basic Kanban board.

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑 START OF NOTES (to be deleted) 🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑

Consider adding a basic screenshot of your Projects Board.

### GitHub Issues

[GitHub Issues](https://github.com/EfthymiaKakoulidou/project-management-tool/issues) served as an another Agile tool.
There, I used my own **User Story Template** to manage user stories.

It also helped with milestone iterations on a weekly basis.

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑 START OF NOTES (to be deleted) 🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑

Consider adding a screenshot of your Open and Closed Issues.

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑 END OF NOTES (to be deleted) 🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑

- [Open Issues](https://github.com/EfthymiaKakoulidou/project-management-tool/issues)

- [Closed Issues](https://github.com/EfthymiaKakoulidou/project-management-tool/issues?q=is%3Aissue+is%3Aclosed)

    ![screenshot](documentation/gh-issues-closed.png)

### MoSCoW Prioritization

I've decomposed my Epics into stories prior to prioritizing and implementing them.
Using this approach, I was able to apply the MoSCow prioritization and labels to my user stories within the Issues tab.

- **Must Have**: guaranteed to be delivered (*max 60% of stories*)
- **Should Have**: adds significant value, but not vital (*the rest ~20% of stories*)
- **Could Have**: has small impact if left out (*20% of stories*)
- **Won't Have**: not a priority for this iteration

## Testing

For all testing, please refer to the [TESTING.md](TESTING.md) file.

## Deployment

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑 END OF NOTES (to be deleted) 🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑

The live deployed application can be found deployed on [Heroku](https://project-management-tool-70101b30ec1e.herokuapp.com).

### ElephantSQL Database

This project uses [ElephantSQL](https://www.elephantsql.com) for the PostgreSQL Database.

To obtain your own Postgres Database, sign-up with your GitHub account, then follow these steps:

- Click **Create New Instance** to start a new database.
- Provide a name (this is commonly the name of the project: project-management-tool).
- Select the **Tiny Turtle (Free)** plan.
- You can leave the **Tags** blank.
- Select the **Region** and **Data Center** closest to you.
- Once created, click on the new database name, where you can view the database URL and Password.

### Cloudinary API

This project uses the [Cloudinary API](https://cloudinary.com) to store media assets online, due to the fact that Heroku doesn't persist this type of data.

To obtain your own Cloudinary API key, create an account and log in.

- For *Primary interest*, you can choose *Programmable Media for image and video API*.
- Optional: *edit your assigned cloud name to something more memorable*.
- On your Cloudinary Dashboard, you can copy your **API Environment Variable**.
- Be sure to remove the `CLOUDINARY_URL=` as part of the API **value**; this is the **key**.

### Heroku Deployment

This project uses [Heroku](https://www.heroku.com), a platform as a service (PaaS) that enables developers to build, run, and operate applications entirely in the cloud.

Deployment steps are as follows, after account setup:

- Select **New** in the top-right corner of your Heroku Dashboard, and select **Create new app** from the dropdown menu.
- Your app name must be unique, and then choose a region closest to you (EU or USA), and finally, select **Create App**.
- From the new app **Settings**, click **Reveal Config Vars**, and set your environment variables.

| Key | Value |
| --- | --- |
| `CLOUDINARY_URL` | user's own value |
| `DATABASE_URL` | user's own value |
| `DISABLE_COLLECTSTATIC` | 1 (*this is temporary, and can be removed for the final deployment*) |
| `SECRET_KEY` | user's own value |

Heroku needs two additional files in order to deploy properly.

- requirements.txt
- Procfile

You can install this project's **requirements** (where applicable) using:

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`

If you have your own packages that have been installed, then the requirements file needs updated using:

- `pip3 freeze --local > requirements.txt`

The **Procfile** can be created with the following command:

- `echo web: gunicorn app_name.wsgi > Procfile`
- *replace **app_name** with the name of your primary Django app name; the folder where settings.py is located*

For Heroku deployment, follow these steps to connect your own GitHub repository to the newly created app:

Either:

- Select **Automatic Deployment** from the Heroku app.

Or:

- In the Terminal/CLI, connect to Heroku using this command: `heroku login -i`
- Set the remote for Heroku: `heroku git:remote -a app_name` (replace *app_name* with your app name)
- After performing the standard Git `add`, `commit`, and `push` to GitHub, you can now type:
	- `git push heroku main`

The project should now be connected and deployed to Heroku!

### Local Deployment

This project can be cloned or forked in order to make a local copy on your own system.

For either method, you will need to install any applicable packages found within the *requirements.txt* file.

- `pip3 install -r requirements.txt`.

You will need to create a new file called `env.py` at the root-level,
and include the same environment variables listed above from the Heroku deployment steps.

Sample `env.py` file:

```python
import os

os.environ.setdefault("CLOUDINARY_URL", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("DATABASE_URL", "user's own value")
os.environ.setdefault("SECRET_KEY", "user's own value")

# local environment only (do not include these in production/deployment!)
os.environ.setdefault("DEBUG", "True")
```

Once the project is cloned or forked, in order to run it locally, you'll need to follow these steps:

- Start the Django app: `python3 manage.py runserver`
- Stop the app once it's loaded: `CTRL+C` or `⌘+C` (Mac)
- Make any necessary migrations: `python3 manage.py makemigrations`
- Migrate the data to the database: `python3 manage.py migrate`
- Create a superuser: `python3 manage.py createsuperuser`
- Load fixtures (if applicable): `python3 manage.py loaddata file-name.json` (repeat for each file)
- Everything should be ready now, so run the Django app again: `python3 manage.py runserver`
