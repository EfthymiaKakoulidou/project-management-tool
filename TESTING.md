In this section, you need to convince the assessors that you have conducted enough testing to legitimately believe that the site works well.
Essentially, in this part, you should go over all of your project's features, and ensure that they all work as intended,
with the project providing an easy and straightforward way for the users to achieve their goals.

## Code Validation

ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ START OF NOTES (to be deleted) ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘

Use the space to discuss code validation for any of your own code files (where applicable).
You are not required to validate external libraries/frameworks, such as imported Bootstrap, Materialize, Font Awesome, etc.

**IMPORTANT**: You must provide a screenshot for each file you validate.

**PRO TIP**: Always validate the live site pages, not your local code. There could be subtle/hidden differences.

### HTML

I have used the recommended [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org) to validate all of my HTML files.

ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ START OF NOTES (to be deleted) ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘

- If you are copying/pasting your HTML code, use this link: https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input
- (*recommended*) If you are using the live deployed site pages, use this link: https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_uri

It's recommended to validate the live pages (each of them) using the deployed URL.
This will give you a custom URL as well, which you can use on your testing documentation.
It makes it easier to return back to a page to validate it again in the future.
The URL will look something like this:

- https://validator.w3.org/nu/?doc=https%3A%2F%2FEfthymiaKakoulidou.github.io%2Fproject-management-tool%2Findex.html

**IMPORTANT**: Python/Jinja syntax in HTML


In order to properly validate these types of files, it's recommended to
[validate by uri](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_uri) from the deployed Heroku pages.

Unfortunately, pages that require a user to be logged-in and authenticated (CRUD functionality),
will not work using this method, due to the fact that the HTML Validator (W3C) doesn't have
access to login to your pages.
In order to properly validate HTML pages with Jinja syntax for authenticated pages, follow these steps:

- Navigate to the deployed pages which require authentication
- Right-click anywhere on the page, and select **View Page Source** (usually `CTRL+U` or `âŒ˜+U` on Mac).
- This will display the entire "compiled" code, without any Jinja syntax.
- Copy everything, and use the [validate by input](https://validator.w3.org/#validate_by_input) method.
- Repeat this process for every page that requires a user to be logged-in/authenticated.

### CSS

I have used the recommended [CSS Jigsaw Validator](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator) to validate all of my CSS files.

ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ START OF NOTES (to be deleted) ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘

- If you are copying/pasting your HTML code, use this link: https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input
- (*recommended*) If you are using the live deployed site, use this link: https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_uri

It's recommended to validate the live site if you only have a single CSS file using the deployed URL.
This will give you a custom URL as well, which you can use on your testing documentation.
It makes it easier to return back to the page to validate it again in the future.
The URL will look something like this:

- https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/validator?uri=https%3A%2F%2FEfthymiaKakoulidou.github.io%2Fproject-management-tool

If you have multiple CSS files, then individual [validation by input](https://jigsaw.w3.org/css-validator/#validate_by_input)
is recommended for the additional CSS files.

**IMPORTANT**: Third-Party tools

If you're using extras like Bootstrap, Materialize, Font Awesome, then sometimes the validator
will attempt to also validate this code, even if it's not part of your own actual code.
You are not required to validate the external libraries or frameworks!

| checkout.css | n/a | ![screenshot](documentation/css-validation-checkout.png) | Pass: No Errors |
| x | x | x | repeat for all remaining CSS files |

### JavaScript

I have used the recommended [JShint Validator](https://jshint.com) to validate all of my JS files.

ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ START OF NOTES (to be deleted) ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘

If using modern JavaScript (ES6) methods, then make sure to include the following
line at the very top of every single JavaScript file (this should remain in your files for submission):

    /* jshint esversion: 11 */

If you are also including jQuery (`$`), then the updated format will be:

    /* jshint esversion: 11, jquery: true */

This allows the JShint validator to recognize modern ES6 methods, such as:
`let`, `const`, `template literals`, `arrow functions (=>)`, etc.

**IMPORTANT**: External resources

Sometimes we'll write JavaScript that imports variables from other files, such as an array of questions
from `questions.js`, which are used within the main `script.js` file elsewhere.
If that's the case, the JShint validation tool doesn't know how to recognize unused variables
that would normally be imported locally in your code.
These warnings are acceptable to showcase on your screenshots.

The same thing applies when using external libraries such as Stripe, Leaflet, Bootstrap, Materialize, etc..
To instantiate these components, we need to use their respective declarator.
Again, the JShint validation tool would flag these as undefined/unused variables.
These warnings are acceptable to showcase on your screenshots.

### Python

ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ START OF NOTES (to be deleted) ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘

The CI Python Linter can be used two different ways.
- Copy/Paste your Python code directly into the linter.
- As an API, using the "raw" URL appended to the linter URL.
    - To find the "raw" URL, navigate to your file directly on the GitHub repo.
    - On that page, GitHub provides a button on the right called "Raw" that you can click on.
    - From that new page, copy the full URL, and paste it after the CI Python Linter URL (with a `/` separator).
    - Check the example table below for a live demo.

It's recommended to validate each file using the API URL.
This will give you a custom URL which you can use on your testing documentation.
It makes it easier to return back to a file to validate it again in the future.
Use the steps above to generate your own custom URLs for each Python file.

**IMPORTANT**: `E501 line too long` errors

You must strive to fix any Python lines that are too long ( >80 characters ).
In rare cases where you cannot break the lines [without breaking the functionality],
then by adding `# noqa` to the end of those lines will ignore linting validation.

`# noqa` = **NO Quality Assurance**

**NOTE**: You must include 2 *spaces* before the `#`, and 1 *space* after the `#`.

Do not use `# noqa` all over your project just to clear down validation errors!
This can still cause a project to fail, for failing to fix actual PEP8 validation errors.

Sometimes strings or variables get too long, or long `if` conditional statements.
These are acceptable instances to use the `# noqa`.

When trying to fix "line too long" errors, try to avoid using `/` to split lines.
A better approach would be to use any type of opening bracket, and hit Enter just after that.

Any opening bracket type will work: `(`, `[`, `{`.

By using an opening bracket, Python knows where to appropriately indent the next line of code,
without having to "guess" yourself and attempt to tab to the correct indentation level.

Sample Python code validation documentation below (tables are extremely helpful!).

**Note**: This gives examples of PP3 (Python-only), and Flask/Django files, so eliminate the ones not applicable to your own project.

ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ END OF NOTES (to be deleted) ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘

I have used the recommended [PEP8 CI Python Linter](https://pep8ci.herokuapp.com) to validate all of my Python files.

| File | CI URL | Screenshot | Notes |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |

| x | x | x | repeat for all remaining Python files |

**IMPORTANT**: Django settings.py

The Django settings.py file comes with 4 lines that are quite long, and will throw the `E501 line too long` error.
This is default behavior, but can be fixed by adding `# noqa` to the end of those lines.

Example:

```python
AUTH_PASSWORD_VALIDATORS = [
    {
        "NAME": "django.contrib.auth.password_validation.UserAttributeSimilarityValidator",  # noqa
    },
    {
        "NAME": "django.contrib.auth.password_validation.MinimumLengthValidator",  # noqa
    },
    {
        "NAME": "django.contrib.auth.password_validation.CommonPasswordValidator",  # noqa
    },
    {
        "NAME": "django.contrib.auth.password_validation.NumericPasswordValidator",  # noqa
    },
]
```

**IMPORTANT**: migration and pycache files

You do not have to ever validate files from the `migrations/` or `pycache/` folders!
Ignore these `.py` files, and validate just the files that you've created or modified.

## Defensive Programming

ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ START OF NOTES (to be deleted) ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘

Defensive programming (defensive design) is extremely important!

When building projects that accept user inputs or forms, you should always test the level of security for each.
Examples of this could include (not limited to):

Forms:
- Users cannot submit an empty form
- Users must enter valid email addresses

PP3 (Python-only):
- Users must enter a valid letter/word/string when prompted
- Users must choose from a specific list only

MS3 (Flask) | MS4/PP4/PP5 (Django):
- Users cannot brute-force a URL to navigate to a restricted page
- Users cannot perform CRUD functionality while logged-out
- User-A should not be able to manipulate data belonging to User-B, or vice versa
- Non-Authenticated users should not be able to access pages that require authentication
- Standard users should not be able to access pages intended for superusers

You'll want to test all functionality on your application, whether it's a standard form,
or uses CRUD functionality for data manipulation on a database.
Make sure to include the `required` attribute on any form-fields that should be mandatory.
Try to access various pages on your site as different user types (User-A, User-B, guest user, admin, superuser).

You should include any manual tests performed, and the expected results/outcome.

Testing should be replicable.
Ideally, tests cases should focus on each individual section of every page on the website.
Each test case should be specific, objective, and step-wise replicable.

Instead of adding a general overview saying that everything works fine,
consider documenting tests on each element of the page
(ie. button clicks, input box validation, navigation links, etc.) by testing them in their happy flow,
and also the bad/exception flow, mentioning the expected and observed results,
and drawing a parallel between them where applicable.

Consider using the following format for manual test cases:

Expected Outcome / Test Performed / Result Received / Fixes Implemented

- **Expected**: "Feature is expected to do X when the user does Y."
- **Testing**: "Tested the feature by doing Y."
- (either) **Result**: "The feature behaved as expected, and it did Y."
- (or) **Result**: "The feature did not respond to A, B, or C."
- **Fix**: "I did Z to the code because something was missing."

Use the table below as a basic start, and expand on it using the logic above.

Defensive programming was manually tested with the below user acceptance testing:

| Page | Expectation | Test | Result | Fix | Screenshot |
| --- | --- | --- | --- | --- | --- |

Another way of performing defensive testing is a simple Pass/Fail for each test.
The assessors prefer the above method, with the full test explained, but this is also acceptable in most cases.

When in doubt, use the above method instead, and delete the table below.

## Automated Testing

I have conducted a series of automated tests on my application.

I fully acknowledge and understand that, in a real-world scenario, an extensive set of additional tests would be more comprehensive.

### JavaScript (Jest Testing)

ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ START OF NOTES (to be deleted) ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘

Adjust the code below (file names, etc.) to match your own project files/folders.

ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ END OF NOTES (to be deleted) ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘

I have used the [Jest](https://jestjs.io) JavaScript testing framework to test the application functionality.

In order to work with Jest, I first had to initialize NPM.

- `npm init`
- Hit `enter` for all options, except for **test command:**, just type `jest`.

Add Jest to a list called **Dev Dependencies** in a dev environment:

- `npm install --save-dev jest`

**IMPORTANT**: Initial configurations

When creating test files, the name of the file needs to be `file-name.test.js` in order for Jest to properly work.

Without the following, Jest won't properly run the tests:

- `npm install -D jest-environment-jsdom`

Due to a change in Jest's default configuration, you'll need to add the following code to the top of the `.test.js` file:

```js
/**
 * @jest-environment jsdom
 */

const { test, expect } = require("@jest/globals");
const { function1, function2, function3, etc. } = require("../script-name");

beforeAll(() => {
    let fs = require("fs");
    let fileContents = fs.readFileSync("index.html", "utf-8");
    document.open();
    document.write(fileContents);
    document.close();
});
```

Remember to adjust the `fs.readFileSync()` to the specific file you'd like you test.
The example above is testing the `index.html` file.

Finally, at the bottom of the script file where your primary scripts are written, include the following at the bottom of the file.
Make sure to include the name of all of your functions that are being tested in the `.test.js` file.

```js
if (typeof module !== "undefined") module.exports = {
    function1, function2, function3, etc.
};
```

Now that these steps have been undertaken, further tests can be written, and be expected to fail initially.
Write JS code that can get the tests to pass as part of the Red-Green refactor process.

Once ready, to run the tests, use this command:

- `npm test`

**NOTE**: To obtain a coverage report, use the following command:

- `npm test --coverage`

Below are the results from the tests that I've written for this application:

| Test Suites | Tests | Screenshot |
| --- | --- | --- |
| 1 passed | 16 passed | ![screenshot](documentation/js-test-coverage.png) |
| x | x | repeat for all remaining tests |

#### Jest Test Issues

### Python (Unit Testing)

ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ END OF NOTES (to be deleted) ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘

I have used Django's built-in unit testing framework to test the application functionality.

In order to run the tests, I ran the following command in the terminal each time:

`python3 manage.py test name-of-app `

To create the coverage report, I would then run the following commands:

`coverage run --source=name-of-app manage.py test`

`coverage report`

To see the HTML version of the reports, and find out whether some pieces of code were missing, I ran the following commands:

`coverage html`

`python3 -m http.server`

Below are the results from the various apps on my application that I've tested:

An improved way to manage bugs is to use the built-in **Issues** tracker on your GitHub repository.
To access your Issues, click on the "Issues" tab at the top of your repository.
Alternatively, use this link: https://github.com/EfthymiaKakoulidou/project-management-tool/issues

If using the Issues tracker for your bug management, you can simplify the documentation process.
Issues allow you to directly paste screenshots into the issue without having to first save the screenshot locally,
then uploading into your project.

You can add labels to your issues (`bug`), assign yourself as the owner, and add comments/updates as you progress with fixing the issue(s).

Once you've sorted the issue, you should then "Close" it.

When showcasing your bug tracking for assessment, you can use the following format:

## Unfixed Bugs

ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ START OF NOTES (to be deleted) ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘

You will need to mention unfixed bugs and why they were not fixed.
This section should include shortcomings of the frameworks or technologies used.
Although time can be a big variable to consider, paucity of time and difficulty understanding
implementation is not a valid reason to leave bugs unfixed.

If you've identified any unfixed bugs, no matter how small, be sure to list them here.
It's better to be honest and list them, because if it's not documented and an assessor finds the issue,
they need to know whether or not you're aware of them as well, and why you've not corrected/fixed them.

Some examples:

ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ END OF NOTES (to be deleted) ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘

- On devices smaller than 375px, the page starts to have `overflow-x` scrolling.

    ![screenshot](documentation/unfixed-bug01.png)

    - Attempted fix: I tried to add additional media queries to handle this, but things started becoming too small to read.

- For PP3, when using a helper `clear()` function, any text above the height of the terminal does not clear, and remains when you scroll up.

    ![screenshot](documentation/unfixed-bug02.png)

    - Attempted fix: I tried to adjust the terminal size, but it only resizes the actual terminal, not the allowable area for text.

- When validating HTML with a semantic `section` element, the validator warns about lacking a header `h2-h6`. This is acceptable.

    ![screenshot](documentation/unfixed-bug03.png)

    - Attempted fix: this is a known warning and acceptable, and my section doesn't require a header since it's dynamically added via JS.

ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ START OF NOTES (to be deleted) ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘

If you legitimately cannot find any unfixed bugs or warnings, then use the following sentence:

ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ END OF NOTES (to be deleted) ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘ðŸ›‘

There are no remaining bugs that I am aware of.
