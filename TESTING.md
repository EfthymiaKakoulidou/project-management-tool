## Code Validation

### HTML

I have used the recommended [HTML W3C Validator](https://validator.w3.org) to validate all of my HTML files.

## Automated Testing

I have conducted a series of automated tests on my application.

I fully acknowledge and understand that, in a real-world scenario, an extensive set of additional tests would be more comprehensive.

### Python (Unit Testing)

I have used Django's built-in unit testing framework to test the application functionality.

In order to run the tests, I ran the following command in the terminal each time:

`python3 manage.py test project_manager `

To create the coverage report, I would then run the following commands:

`coverage run --source=name-of-app manage.py test`

`coverage report`

To see the HTML version of the reports, and find out whether some pieces of code were missing, I ran the following commands:

`coverage html`

`python3 -m http.server`

Below are the results from the various apps on my application that I've tested:

| App | File | Coverage | Screenshot |
| --- | --- | --- | --- |
| project_manager | test_forms.py | 99% | ![screenshot](documentation/py-test-bag-forms.jpg) |
| project_manager | test_models.py | 89% | ![screenshot](documentation/py-test-bag-models.jpg) |
| project_manager | test_urls.py | 100% | ![screenshot](documentation/py-test-bag-urls.jpg) |
| project_manager | test_views.py | 71% | ![screenshot](documentation/py-test-bag-views.jpg) |


#### Unit Test Issues


## Bugs

- Python 

    - I encountered an error trying to to have 2 queries in one function separately and that did not work properly. 

    - To fix this, I I restrustured the code to make one query for all.

- Django `TemplateDoesNotExist`

    - To fix this, I adjusted my urls patterns accordingly to accept rendering from the respective views.

- Python `E501 line too long` 

    - To fix this, I cut the line so that it would continue to the next line without breaking the functionality..

### GitHub **Issues**

🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑🛑-START OF NOTES (to be deleted)

An improved way to manage bugs is to use the built-in **Issues** tracker on your GitHub repository.
To access your Issues, click on the "Issues" tab at the top of your repository.
Alternatively, use this link: https://github.com/EfthymiaKakoulidou/project-management-tool/issues

If using the Issues tracker for your bug management, you can simplify the documentation process.
Issues allow you to directly paste screenshots into the issue without having to first save the screenshot locally,
then uploading into your project.

You can add labels to your issues (`bug`), assign yourself as the owner, and add comments/updates as you progress with fixing the issue(s).

Once you've sorted the issue, you should then "Close" it.

When showcasing your bug tracking for assessment, you can use the following format:

**Fixed Bugs**


- When validating HTML the validator warned that there were unclosed tags. This happened because the closing tag was before the closing tag of an if statement which was not executed so the validator did not see it. I fixed this by moving the closing tag after the is statement.

## Unfixed Bugs


    ![screenshot](documentation/unfixed-bug03.jpg)

    - Attempted fix: this is a known warning and acceptable, and my section doesn't require a header since it's dynamically added via JS.

There are no remaining bugs that I am aware of.
